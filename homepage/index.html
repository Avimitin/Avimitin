<p>Welcome! This is <a href="https://sh1mar.in"
class="uri">https://sh1mar.in</a>.</p>
<p>The name is inspired by my favorite anime character, 志摩 リン (Shima
Rin) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laid-Back_Camp">Yuru
Camp</a>, with the letter ‘i’ replaced with ‘1’.</p>
<h2 id="about-me">About Me</h2>
<p>I’m a passionate software developer with a love for both modern and
classic approaches to web design. While I’ve worked with React for
frontend development, there’s something charming about pure HTML and
minimal CSS – which is why this homepage embraces that simplicity.</p>
<p>As a self-proclaimed Linux terminal enthusiast, I find joy in
crafting an elegant and modern development UI. Much of my time is spent
fine-tuning my neovim and tmux setup. It might seem like a quirky hobby,
but it’s one that brings me satisfaction and improves my workflow.</p>
<p>My primary programming language is Rust, and I manage projects with
Nix. I’ve also dabbled in Scala and C++, though I’m still on the journey
to mastering these challenging languages. Recently, I’ve been exploring
Haskell as a potential daily driver. Its declarative and immutable
programming model offers a refreshing perspective, even if it comes with
its own learning curve.</p>
<p>Architecture and operating systems are my main areas of interest
within computer science. I’m constantly working to deepen my
understanding of these fields, with the goal of becoming an Architecture
and Kernel engineer in the future.</p>
<p>I’ve contributed to several open-source projects, which you can check
out on my <a href="https://github.com/Avimitin">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>When I’m not immersed in code, I’m an enthusiastic consumer of anime
and games. I have a particular fondness for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Moody, stream-of-consciousness animations like <a
href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Boy">Sonny Boy</a></li>
<li>Emotionally stirring series such as <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_la_Kill">Kill la Kill</a></li>
<li>Character-driven narratives like <a
href="https://www.monogatari-series.com/bakemonogatari/">化物語</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I also enjoy American TV classics like House of Cards and Breaking
Bad.</p>
<p>In the gaming world, I’m eclectic in my tastes. From the challenging
landscapes of Elden Ring to the narrative depth of visual novels like
Witch of the Holy Night, or the expansive JRPG worlds of the Persona
series – I find enjoyment across genres.</p>
<p>Feel free to connect with me on <a
href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16900842">osu</a> or <a
href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/sh1marin/">Steam</a> if you’d like
to game together!</p>
