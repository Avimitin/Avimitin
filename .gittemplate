# Guideline:
# Title: Summary, imperative, lower case, don't end with a period
# <package>: <short summary>
#   │        │
#   │        └─⫸ Summary in present tense. Not capitalized. No period at the end.
#   │
#   └─⫸ The primary package of the project which have been affected.
#
# A rule of thumb is that it should be written to complete this
# sentence: "If applied, this patch will modify the project to...".
# Example: socket: create buffer when open new stream
#
# Body: Include task ID like Fixes #<issue ID> or Closes #<pr ID>.
# The rest of the description elaborates and should provide context for the
# change and explain what it does. Write in complete sentences with correct
# punctuation, just like for your comments in code. Don't use HTML, Markdown, 
# or any other markup language.
