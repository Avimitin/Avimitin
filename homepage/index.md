![head-img](./head-img.png)

Welcome! This is <https://sh1mar.in>.

The name is inspired by my favorite anime character, 志摩 リン (Shima Rin) from [Yuru Camp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laid-Back_Camp),
with the letter 'i' replaced with '1'.

## About Me

I'm a passionate software developer with a love for both modern and classic
approaches to web design. While I've worked with React for frontend
development, there's something charming about pure HTML and minimal CSS – which
is why this homepage embraces that simplicity.

As a self-proclaimed Linux terminal enthusiast, I find joy in crafting an
elegant and modern development UI. Much of my time is spent fine-tuning my
neovim and tmux setup. It might seem like a quirky hobby, but it's one that
brings me satisfaction and improves my workflow.

My primary programming language is Rust, and I manage projects with Nix. I've
also dabbled in Scala and C++, though I'm still on the journey to mastering
these challenging languages. Recently, I've been exploring Haskell as a
potential daily driver. Its declarative and immutable programming model offers
a refreshing perspective, even if it comes with its own learning curve.

Architecture and operating systems are my main areas of interest within
computer science. I'm constantly working to deepen my understanding of these
fields, with the goal of becoming an Architecture and Kernel engineer in the
future.

I've contributed to several open-source projects, which you can check out on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/Avimitin).

When I'm not immersed in code, I'm an enthusiastic consumer of anime and games.
I have a particular fondness for:

- Moody, stream-of-consciousness animations like [Sonny Boy](https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Boy)
- Emotionally stirring series such as [Kill la Kill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_la_Kill)
- Character-driven narratives like [化物語](https://www.monogatari-series.com/bakemonogatari/)

I also enjoy American TV classics like House of Cards and Breaking Bad.

In the gaming world, I'm eclectic in my tastes. From the challenging landscapes
of Elden Ring to the narrative depth of visual novels like Witch of the Holy
Night, or the expansive JRPG worlds of the Persona series – I find enjoyment
across genres.

Feel free to connect with me on [osu](https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16900842) or
[Steam](https://steamcommunity.com/id/sh1marin/) if you'd like to game
together!
