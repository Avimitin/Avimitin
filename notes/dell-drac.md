# Dell DRAC

The Dell Remote Access Controller (DRAC) is an [[out-of-band-management]] platform on
certain Dell servers. The platform may be provided on a separate expansion card, or
integrated into the main board. When integrated, the platform is referred to as iDRAC.

The controller has its own processor, memory, network connection, and access to the system
bus. Key features include power management, virtual media access and remote console
capabilities, all available through a supported web browser or command-line interface.
