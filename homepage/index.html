<p>Welcome! This is <a href="https://sh1mar.in"
class="uri">https://sh1mar.in</a>.</p>
<p>The name is inspired by my favorite anime character, 志摩 リン (Shima
Rin) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laid-Back_Camp">Yuru
Camp</a>, with the letter ‘i’ replaced with ‘1’.</p>
<h2 id="who-am-i">Who am I</h2>
<p>I’m passionate about creating software and have contributed to a few
open-source projects on <a
href="https://github.com/Avimitin">GitHub</a>.</p>
<p>While I have experience with frontend development using React, I have
a soft spot for old-school web design. That’s why this homepage is built
with pure HTML and minimal CSS.</p>
<p>I’m a self-proclaimed Linux terminal enthusiast and spend a lot of
time customizing my neovim and tmux setup. It might seem useless
spending time on this, but I found enjoyment from crafting an elegant
and modern development UI.</p>
<p>My primary programming languages are Rust, and I manage projects with
Nix. I also have extensive experience with Scala and C++, but I wouldn’t
claim mastery over them – they’re both quite challenging! :(</p>
<p>Due to some disillusionment with the Rust community and its culture,
I’ve started learning Haskell. I’m exploring it as a potential
replacement for my daily programming language. While Haskell is also
demanding, I find the declarative and immutable programming model quite
refreshing.</p>
<p>My main interests within computer science are architecture and
operating systems. I’m continually striving to deepen my understanding
of these areas. And I would love to be an Architecture and Kernel
engineer in the near future.</p>
<p>Besides programming, I’m an avid anime and game enthusiast. For
animation, I really like moody, stream-of-consciousness animation like
<a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonny_Boy">Sonny Boy</a>,
emotionally stirring animation like <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kill_la_Kill">Kill la Kill</a>, and
character-driven animation like <a
href="https://www.monogatari-series.com/bakemonogatari/">化物語</a>. I
also often watch some American TV Shows, like House of Cards, Breaking
Bad and other classics.</p>
<p>I have no particular preference for the type of game. Games like the
soul-like game of Elden ring, the visual novel genre of Witch of the
Holy Night, or the generic JRPG Persona series, I really enjoy. You can
find me on <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh/users/16900842">osu</a> and <a
href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/sh1marin/">Steam</a>.</p>
