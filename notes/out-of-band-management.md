# Out-of-band management

In systems management, out-of-band management (OOB; also lights-out management or LOM)
is a process for accessing and managing devices and infrastructure at remote locations
through a separate management plane from the production network. OOB allows a system
administrator to monitor and manage servers and other network-attached equipment by remote
control regardless of whether the machine is powered on or whether an OS is installed or
functional. It is contrasted to in-band management which requires the managed systems to
be powered on and available over their operating system's networking facilities.

OOB can use dedicated management interfaces, serial ports, or cellular 4G and 5G networks
for connectivity.

Out-of-band management is now considered an essential network component to ensure business
continuity and many manufacturers have it as a product offering.
