## ***Skills***

* Familiar with **Rust**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **Ruby**, **C**, **nix** and **Lua**

### My highlight projects

- (Rust) [tg-maid](https://github.com/Avimitin/tg-maid)

A telegram bot that was used as my Rust playground. I applied all my skill I had learned into this project.
Such as a generic dispatchable task executor: <https://github.com/Avimitin/tg-maid/blob/master/src/event.rs#L56-L133>.

- (Rust) [deepl-rs](https://github.com/Avimitin/deepl-rs.git)

A Rust DeepL API wrapper. In this project I used the Rust await syntax sugar to inline the HTTP request into async/await.

- (TypeScript & Ruby) [uptime-collector](https://github.com/Avimitin/uptime-collector.git)

This is a lightweight CPU usage collector, using React as frontend and Ruby as backend.

- (Lua) [nvim](https://github.com/Avimitin/nvim)

A structure and super fast neovim configuration that purely made with Lua.
I made so many optimization and customization to exploit the speed from LuaJIT.

- (nix) vector

I've maintain LLVM with nix in the [sequencer/vector](https://github.com/sequencer/vector/pull/230/files) repo.
Also, this repository contains many nix code to maintain my dotfile.

- [Arch Linux RISC-V](https://github.com/felixonmars/archriscv-packages/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3A%40me+sort%3Aupdated-desc+)

I was an active maintainer for Arch Linux RISC-V distro.
